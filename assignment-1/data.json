The draft, Entitled \u201cIn They Image\u201d opens with Captain Kirk and his girlfriend, Alexandria, Swimming naked. When he is contacted by Starfleet on his wrist communicator, Alexandria pulls him down under the water. That seems mild enough, But that was just the beginning. Along with two female yeomans asking a new Vulcan science officer about pon-farr, The script had Kirk and the Deltan, Ilia, In a conversation that would have raised eyebrows. When Kirk meets Ilia, He tells her he knows Deltan females are not wanton, Hairless whores, A comment which has her laughing delightedly (according to the screenplay). And she retorts \u201con my world, Existence is loving, Pleasuring, Sharing, Caring. \u201d Kirk responds by asking her if she\u2019s ever \u201csexed\u201d with a human. After Ilia is taken over by V-Ger (Ve-jur in the script) and replaced with the probe we did see onscreen, Things heat up even more. The Ilia-probe is especially interested in Captain Kirk and wants to get to know him in a more intimate manner. \u201cKirk, Let us make sex. In a few hours, Ve-jur will arrive. I will return to my original form. \u201dThe Motion Picture draft was discardedIn Roddenberry\u2019s script (as described in The Fifty-Year Mission-The First 25 Years) both Decker and Ilia survived and presumably live happily ever after. That is, If she doesn\u2019t get too attached to Captain Kirk. There\u2019s no telling how much time Kirk would have actually spent on the bridge in this version, As between a girlfriend, Ilia, And an alien probe, He would have been kept a little busy. While some fans might think a little bit of sex would have spiced things up in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The director of the movie, Bob Collins, And other studio execs didn\u2019t agree, And Roddenberry\u2019s script was scrapped. \"", "A Born Again Star Trek Sermon & Kirk- Continued": "The article continues \"Of Mexican heritage, Ramirez was always fascinated with the astrophysical knowledge of the pre-Columbian Mayan culture and its symbols.

So Ramirez began weaving those elements into art projects. It was a big change in tone. Before she began focusing on \"Star Trek, \" Ramirez had painted a series of sorrowful, Large-scale, Still lifes of the possessions left behind by undocumented immigrants who died in the deserts of the Southwest, Attempting to enter the United States. Some people wept as they considered the implications of those paintings, She said. The works were powerful, But relentlessly grim. Spending time considering the symbolic implications of Sulu, Chekov, Scotty, And the rest was an emotional respite. Over the past four years, Ramirez wrote her own \"Star Trek\" episode, Incorporating time-travel with cosmic criticism of the 45th president. She also delivered a Unitarian Universalist sermon based on her belief that \"Star Trek\" mythology could inspire ethical guidance in life. And for art exhibits in 2019 and 2020, She painted heroic, Baroque-style portraits of the crew, Depicting Captain Kirk in the Native American clothing he wore in one particularly compelling, Culture-crossing episode. Speaking of Captain Kirk, In 2020, Ramirez paid for an opportunity to visit one-on-one with William Shatner, The actor who played Captain Kirk. During their brief Zoom session, She found him completely charming. The experience wasn\u2019t cheap, She said laughing, \u201cbut it was worth every penny. \u201dUnfortunately, As the Rolling Stones (contemporaries of \"Star Trek\") put it, Time waits for no one. A few of the actors from the original 1960s series have passed away and others are quite, Quite old. Ramirez said the Mayans believed that when we die, Our spirits rise and dissolve into the cloudy Milky Way.

Something drew her to the original Star Trek episodes. Sure, The special effects were primitive and some of the situations a touch trite, But overall, She thought, The series held up pretty well. In fact, Many of the episodes seemed a perfect fit with the current conditions in the country, As the crew of the Starship Enterprise confronted intergalactic racism, Societal strife and other challenges. \"Star Trek, \" which was set in the 23rd century, Was way ahead of its time, Ramirez concluded. The humanity embodied by the integrated crew seemed to be an antidote to the divisions among Americans. But that wasn\u2019t the reason for her rebirth as a Star Trek disciple.

Kirk\u2019s middle name came to be isn\u2019t set in stone\"If you\u2019ve watched Star Trek: The Animated Series, You know that the 17th episode of the series entitled \u201cBem\u201d provided Captain James T. Kirk\u2019s middle name as Tiberius. But from where did such an unusual middle name originate? Turns out, Captain Kirk owes his middle name to Roman history\u2026maybe. David Gerrold, Who wrote \u201cBem\u201d as well as \u201cMore Tribbles, More Troubles\u201d for The Animated Series as well as \u201cThe Trouble with Tribbles\u201d for The Original Series, Was attending a Star Trek convention with D. C. Fontana when someone from the audience asked them what Kirk\u2019s middle name was. Gerrold had just finished reading a book on Roman history and still had Tiberius in his head. So that was his immediate response. And the audience was very enthusiastic about the name. But did Captain James. T. Kirk really get his middle name from David Gerrold? Gerrold shared the middle name with Gene Roddenberry who approved it, And Tiberius was used for the first time in The Animated Series. The name became a part of live- canon when it was used in the final movie that featured the original cast, Star Trek: VI The Undiscovered Country. It was during the trial of Captain Kirk and Doctor McCoy for the death of the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon. Though Gerrold shared this behind-the-scenes tidbit about the middle name in The Fifty-Year Mission (The First 25 Years), There is some who don\u2019t agree as the full name of the main character in Gene Roddenberry\u2019s 1964 series The Lieutenant was William Tiberius Rice. And many believe that\u2019s where the name came from. Either way, We would have had the same middle name, And had \u201cBem\u201d been used as a third season episode of The Original Series, As it had been pitched, We would have known Captain Kirk\u2019s middle name sooner. Regardless of how the middle name came to be, The unusual moniker perfectly suits Captain James T. Kirk. \"", "Kirk's Brother in the Kelvin Timeline- Continued": "The article continues :Where Is George In The Kelvin Timeline? 2009's Star Trek explored Kirk's childhood growing up in rural Iowa, Much like his Prime Universe counterpart. An early scene sees the young Kirk stealing his Uncle's car and calling out to a hitchhiking boy named \"Johnny\" (played by Spencer Daniels) before being chased by police. Though \"Johnny\" simply seems to be a random acquaintance of Kirk's, A deleted scene shows that he was actually intended to be Sam Kirk. The cut scene featured Sam as he runs away from the family home after an argument with their Uncle Frank. Young James begs his brother not to leave, But Sam assures him he'll be fine, Noting that James has always had good grades and followed orders. The scene ends with James dutifully washing Uncle Frank's car before rebelliously deciding to steal it. This would've led straight into the high-speed chase that was included in the film's final cut. Renaming the character \"Johnny\" was most likely a decision made in editing. After all, Sam was not present on the Kelvin during the opening scene, So it would have been a little confusing to suddenly introduce an older brother out of the blue if they had deleted the prior scene. So, While Sam Kirk was nearly included within the reboot, His status as part of the official Kelvin Timeline canon is still unclear. That being said, There is still a chance that Sam could be introduced in a future project, Perhaps in the long-rumored fourth installment of the Kelvin film series. If Star Trek has proved one thing throughout its decades-long history, It's that the franchise always finds a way to patch holes in its continuity. \"", "Kirk's Brother in the Kelvin Timeline": ". . . The website   cbr. Com has an article on April 26, 2021 headlined \"Star Trek: Wait, What Happened to Kirk's Brother in the Kelvin Timeline? \" the article says:A deleted scene from 2009's Star Trek reveals plans to include Captain Kirk's older brother in the Kelvin Timeline. BY ANTHONY AMBROSE\"The 2009 film Star Trek established an alternate, Yet parallel timeline to the Prime Star Trek chronology, Diverging at the point in time when Nero's ship exits a black hole and engages the Federation ship the U. S. S. Kelvin in battle. This battle claimed the life of James T. Kirk's father George, Setting the iconic protagonist on a slightly different path to growing up into the legendary starship Captain he was destined to become. Despite this change to the character's origins, It was established in The Original Series that Kirk had an older brother named George Samuel \"Sam\" Kirk, Who worked as a scientist. As Sam would have been born before the arrival of the Narada and its battle with the Kelvin, That would mean that he would most surely exist within the Kelvin timeline. However, There is no mention of Sam Kirk in the 2009 movie, Nor in its sequels. Though this at first appears to be an oversight, The filmmakers of the reboot had actually planned to introduce Kirk's older brother and even shot a scene featuring Sam. Let's explore who George Samuel Kirk was in the Prime Timeline and what his scrapped role in the Kelvin Timeline would've consisted of. Who Is George Samuel Kirk? George Samuel Kirk made his first and only appearance in an episode of The Original Series titled \"Operation: Annihilate! \" In the episode, Captain Kirk is desperate to reach his scientist brother, Who lives on the planet Deneva, Which is next in line in a pattern of mass insanity. After beaming down to the planet with a landing party, Kirk soon finds the dead body of his brother (played by William Shatner sporting a fake mustache) and beams up his infected sister-in-law Aurelan and nephew Peter. The crew soon discovers that the planet had been besieged by flying parasites, Which soon infect Spock and claim the life of Aurelan. Fortunately, The crew is finally able to defeat the parasites using ultraviolet light, Curing the surviving Denevans, As well as Spock and Peter. While the episode doesn't focus too heavily on Kirk's emotions related to the death of his brother, It's one of the rare times fans actually see Kirk's family onscreen. However, The choice to kill off almost all of them is a strange one, Especially given that in another episode, Kirk fondly recalled a memory of Sam and his family seeing him off on his five-year mission on the Enterprise. \"", "Will the Real Star Trek Please Beam Up? Part 3": "The article lastly says:\"But for the many of us who know these characters from earlier stories such as The Wrath of Khan, Where Spock speaks that same phrase to Kirk while sacrificing himself to save the Enterprise. Whatever the feelings between old Spock and new Kirk, My heart fills with emotion when I hear those words. As we know from Star Trek Into Darkness, Which reverses the sacrifice and leaves Kirk dead after Khan\u2019s attack, Pine and Quinto\u2019s characters will never say those words to each other. But Shatner and Nimoy\u2019s characters do say them every time I re-watch Wrath of Khan. By bifurcating the timeline, Star Trek (2009) makes literal an aspect of Trek that has always been true. There can be multiple interpretations of the characters, And they are valid. Leaving aside big contradictions, Like the conflicting appearances of Klingons or Trills, Trek has always invited differing interpretations because that\u2019s the way interpretation works. We\u2019re all different people, And we all bring different expectations, Desires, And beliefs to a piece of fiction. No one person owns the one correct version. In an earlier life, Nimoy\u2019s Spock taught Shatner\u2019s Kirk another important lesson, One drawn from Vulcan philosophy. Infinite diversity in infinite combinations has become a core part of Trek fandom, An essential part for celebrating the different races, Genders, Body types, And sexualities who contribute to the franchise\u2019s continuing mission. It\u2019s important to remember that infinite diversity also refers to our interpretations and experiences with these characters. The TOS episodes my uncle loved are real Trek, The 90s stories I love are real Trek, And the 2009 film is real Trek because there is no one \u201creal\u201d Trek. As the 2009 film reminds us, There are infinite Treks in infinite combinations, And it\u2019s the privilege of all fans to seek out strange new interpretations. \"", "Will the real Star Trek Please Beam Up? Continued": "The article continues :\"The movie\u2019s critics complain that it isn\u2019t real Trek because Pine and Quinto don\u2019t play the same Kirk and Spock from TOS. But here\u2019s the thing: the movie agrees! In fact, The movie is very much about the fact that the lives of the Enterprise crew are not quite right. Nero changed reality from the moment of Kirk\u2019s birth and his actions reverberate throughout the galaxy. The characters we once knew come into being in an all-new environment, And thus make different choices. Unmoored by the loss of his father, Kirk indulges in his reckless impulses. The cocky romantic fans saw in an episode like   \u201cDagger of the Mind\u201d has been replaced by a womanizing barfly who picks fights with visiting Starfleet cadets. Spock\u2019s reality changes when Nero destroys Vulcan and kills his mother Amanda (Winona Ryder). Once the child of two worlds, Spock now has only Earth for a home. Wishing to honor his mother\u2019s memory, Spock embraces his human side, Making for a more emotional half-Vulcan. In this new timeline, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) avoids the accident that leaves him scarred, Chekov (Anton Yelchin) joins the bridge crew much earlier, And Uhura\u2019s (Zoe Saldana) xenolinguistic skills earn more respect. Because they are different people living in a different reality, These characters will not have the same adventures as the versions we saw before. They won\u2019t be overrun with Tribbles, Nor will a noble commander be their first introduction to the Romulans. For this Enterprise crew, These things never happened and they never will. But as Nero himself would put it, It happened, Don\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen, I saw it happen. No matter what happens in the reboot movies, All of The Original Series and movies still exist. You can watch \u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever\u201d on the same day that you watch Star Trek (2009), Which I did while prepping for this article. Once again, The movie makes this fact part of its plot, As illustrated in a scene that brings together the old and the new. After being marooned by Spock on an ice planet, Kirk encounters Ambassador Spock, Played again by Nimoy. \u201cJames T. Kirk, \u201d Spock says to Pine\u2019s character (with, I hasten to add, More than a little emotion in his voice). When Kirk asks how this elderly man knows who he is, Spock answers, \u201cI have been and always shall be your friend. \u201dTo Pine\u2019s Kirk, Spock\u2019s answer is bewildering and devoid of sentiment. Spock has not always been his friend; he just left Kirk to die on this planet. Nor does it make sense for the many people who first met these characters in this film. The line only gains meaning for them when Spock explains that he, Even the angry and hurting version, Needs Kirk as an anchor. \"", "Will the Real Star Trek Please Beam Up?": ". . . . From Startrek.

Granted, TNG was only in its third season when my uncle made his remark, But the lesson to me was clear. Complaining about Trek is almost as old as Trek itself. It would have been no problem if my uncle simply said that he disliked TNG. Everyone has their preferences, Even in a franchise they love. But when he said that TNG wasn\u2019t real Star Trek, My uncle went too far. Of course, TNG is real Star Trek.

Nearly every series has been dismissed as \u201cnot real Trek\u201d for some reason or another, From the station-bound stories in Deep Space Nine to the emotional rawness of Discovery. But no Trek franchise has received as much ire as the reboot films, Starting with 2009\u2019s Star Trek.

Director J. J. Abrams has little use for the diplomatic dialogues and philosophical arguments found in many Trek classics, Preferring instead lens flares and explosions. The script from Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman contains plenty of nods to previous adventures, Including an apple-munching Kirk defeating the Kobayashi Maru simulation. But the film\u2019s plot, In which the elderly Ambassador Spock (Nimoy) and the Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) travel to the past after the destruction of Romulus, Is a different beast entirely.

I blame Obama.", "Its homosexuality, Not the homosexual that is evil": "For the past few decades we have seen a ever growing trend to accept the practice of homosexuality. This however is a dangerous one. With the LGBTQ+ movement leading the charge, It wishes to re define the meaning of marriage, Family, Sex and the difference between man and womanhood. Firstly, With the subject of marriage. Within our Western culture, For centuries, Marriage has always been seen as an institution for a man and women to raise a family. To this day it is still the best way to raise children hands down. Now apart from a very few exceptions a same sex marriage can not provide that for obvious reasons. Upon the subject of sex, Gay sex can not be seen as moral as it does not allow the procreation of children. One cannot just separate procreation and pleasure as otherwise sex becomes meaningless and casual. The effects of the sexual revelation can be seen today, With the rise of STDs, Teenage pregnancy, Rise of abortions, Pornography, Sex trafficking and the list goes on. Moreover it is visible within LGBTQ+ organised Pride parades that sexual deviancy is promoted by a visible few, Which then increases the number of problems that I have already stated.

Each decision individually is tested against the limits of morality, And if you fall outside those limits you risk being burned. People know beforehand the consequences of choosing a deviant sexual relationship (they could choose any). It doesn't have to even be homosexual. The worst part of a homosexual relationship is that you bring another person down to your level \u2026 like using (drugs) with another person. In doing anything with them you empower them and make them feel like its normal and ok. Then that sentiment sticks with them like any addiction. Hell, People with addictions even think sometimes they were born that way, Predestined to use, As if they have nowhere else to turn. Its all just a denial to help justify to themselves what they are doing. The problems are self evident:1) Over emphasis on sexual pleasures \u2026 ones that can never amount to offspring as it was meant to (you can buck Darwinism if you don't like that). 2) you deprive yourself the true balance of having a hetero relationship. 3) You open yourself up to throwing out other good guidance from sources such as the bible, Just because it doesn't reflect the way you want to be. 4) You act against the idea that people are unique in that you have determined that there is no opposite sex partner for you. (prison stats clearly demonstrate that homosexuality is situational based \u2026 or worse that if people are born this way that they are also predisposed criminals)   Predisposition for crime though might support what I said above in all the other points, Though im not saying that they have that at this point. 5) Exhibit selfishness in that they are willing to walk such a hard uphill battle against nature for their own sexual pleasure. Or the fact that they don't walk what they perceive to be an even harder line by following through with the morally right path that's been presented to them. Just all round its a very belittling practice. It doesn't buy any respect for the human race, It makes us look like animals. It demonstrates that we can't handle emotions or look past our basic instincts. Its primal and disgusting, As primal and disgusting as violence against innocents is.

Nobody dies as a result of passing by a transgender person in the street. The opposition states that these are \"dangerous ideologies\" perpetuated by \"cultural Marxists\". This is patently false, As gay sex has been observed both in nature and in societies that developed before Karl Marx's writings or any of their derivatives. The statement that gay sex \"spreads sexually transmitted diseases\" is irrelevant, As any kind of sex is capable of spreading disease without proper protection and testing. The claim that it \"lessens population growth\" is similarly useless, As population growth reduces in response to a vast number of other variables, Most notably education and standard of living. Blaming gay people for a decrease in population growth arbitrarily ignores the other, More substantive influences. The claim that either gay or transgender people are \"degenerating the nation\" is entirely without substantiation. The opposition does not care, Of course, Because the intent is only to latch onto a convenient scapegoat for the systemic failures of late-stage capitalism. The claim that sexual and gender minorities are grasping for privileges as the cost of the majority is just as unfounded as the rest.

You can see that in the last week the protests have become less violent, Coincidentally just as the police force in the USA becomes more civil as they are globally condemned for their response to the protests. Some statues have been removed, However many protestors instead want people to recognise that the historical people we hold up as champions were not perfect, And had some deep flaws based on society at the time.

Although White individuals may be killed more often by Police than Black individuals, You would expect this when they make up around 60% of the population compared to 26%. When taking into consideration percent of the population by skin colour, Black individuals are 3 times as more likely to be killed than their White colleagues. Police are also not charged 99% of the time, Which shows just how much they get away with. At most they may have to switch county, But they are still able to remain police officers.
