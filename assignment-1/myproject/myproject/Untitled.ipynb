William Shatner posted a message showing his support for the franchise, And now there\\'s some hopeful it means he\\'s looking to get involved in the franchise. For those who missed the message, William Shatner\\'s tweet was short and sweet. He wished Star Wars fans well and even included an image that can perhaps best be described as a Boomer meme? I said \"perhaps! \"The message was met with love from both sides of the aisle, Though there seemed to be a few more Star Trek fans who wished to throw some shade at the Star Wars holiday. One fan gently reminded William Shatner that he wasn\\'t part of the franchise, To which the actor quoted Spaceballs in a very interesting way. William Shatner is not a part of the Star Wars franchise, But this jokey tweet implies there\\'s still time for him to get on board. The 90-year-old actor isn\\'t exactly wrong, And given that the Star Wars universe is going full-throttle on television projects, There\\'s no shortage of opportunities for him to potentially join up. (Think of all the random famous people who have played Stormtroopers over the years. ) Could this all be a subtle tease he\\'s about to voice a character in something like Star Wars: The Bad Batch or even appear in a live-action series? Of course, We haven\\'t heard anything about that, But if William Shatner did join the world of Star Wars, He wouldn\\'t be the first Star Trek actor to do so. The likes of Simon Pegg, Brent Spiner, And even Shatner\\'s former co-star George Takei have played parts in both franchises, And there\\'s plenty of room in Hollywood to do both. With that being said, There are certainly some who may see Shatner joining Star Wars as a betrayal, Especially given he\\'s the man largely responsible for the success of Star Trek. I would also wager that are many others who would be completely fine and aren\\'t as militant about aligning themselves with just Star Wars or Star Trek. That said, William Shatner has gone a long time without rejoining Star Trek in any capacity, So I think he could catch some flak for that. \"',\n",

While giving your baby a Star Trek-inspired name isn’t a guarantee that they’ll “live long and prosper, ” sci-fi baby names do give parents a lot of fun potential for future birthday party themes, Bedroom decor, And more. A baby name attached to a sci-fi franchise also doesn’t automatically mean your kid will be a super fan, Either.

Popular baby names like Olivia and Noah have their place and all, But I’m sure I’m not the only sci-fi fan who wants to see more Gamoras and Gandlafs. Maybe only mega-fans are really going to name their baby something like Katniss, But there are still plenty of names on this list that are sci-fi adjacent without being totally in-your-face about it. 7KirkDespite the lasting popularity of Captain Kirk among Trekkies, The name hasn’t been in the SSA’s top 1000 popular baby names since 2002.

Com   article': 'The article continues \"Indeed, A researcher from the China Academy of Space Technology Corporation, Pang Zhihao, Said, According to the US media, A space solar power station held the promise of providing “an inexhaustible source of clean energy for humans”. Can you imagine the potential? Electric cars charged at any time and place. Support for our energy needs on a daily basis regardless of weather conditions. And of course, In a clean, Net-zero way. It does sound like Sci-fi, Also given the fact that writer Isaac Asimov is credited with the idea of space-based solar power projects since 1941 (that’s the year he wrote his short story Reason that explores the topic). However, It is not. Space-based solar power (SBSP) is not a new idea and it involves collecting the sun’s energy while in space and wirelessly transmitting it back to Earth. The SBSP tech uses “solar panels to collect solar energy in space with reflectors of inflatable mirrors that direct solar radiation onto solar panels and then beaming it on Earth through a microwave or laser. The energy is then received on Earth via a microwave antenna” according to a blog post on the website Greenmatch. And it seems like the Chinese scientists are determined to prove the technology right. Between 2021 and 2025, According to an article from The Sydney Morning Herald, They first plan to build small and medium-sized solar power stations and subsequently launch them to the stratosphere to generate electricity. And the next step is to build a Megawatt level space solar power station by 2030. Thus, Probably becoming the first country with an operational solar power station in space that actually produces electricity. And what exactly is the EU doing on the matter? There are some individual projects, Like France’s Eutelsat investment, But nothing anywhere near the Chinese endeavour. This makes me also wonder…   while we, In Europe, Argue about which one is the cheapest, Safest and cleanest source of renewable energy on Earth (hydrogen, Solar, Wind, Nuclear), Did China just changed the game (and its terrain) underneath our noses and is about to leave us all behind?

In the \"Best of Both Worlds\" timeline, Shelby leaves the Enterprise after a short stint to help rebuild the parts of the Federation that the Borg destroyed. But in this timeline, She is still aboard the Enterprise and full of bitter resentment for Captain Riker for not following her lead years ago. After seeing the plight of the crew and the universe, Picard and his crew agree to help rescue Locutus and defeat the Borg. After all, They\\'ve done it once already, And this time they have two ships. Both crews journey to Earth where Locutus is being held. They fight a horde of Borg soldiers and manage to beam back onto the Enterprise with Locutus in tow, But they aren\\'t unscathed, As this universe\\'s Worf died in the battle. Data establishes a neural link to the Locutus and commands all of the Borg soldiers to \"Eat\" at once. This causes them to drain all of their power sources, Thus defeating the Borg empire and freeing Picard. Once Picard has recovered from his time as Locutus, He reveals that he channeled all of humanity\\'s subconscious desire to defeat the Borg to open up a rift between dimensions and summon the other Enterprise. The original crew heads back home through the same dimensional rift, Leaving behind a newly freed, But still wounded universe. While Star Trek: The Next Generation featured plenty of timelines where events played out differently, This stands as one of the darkest turns of events in this iteration of the sci-fi franchise. The Borg were arguably this era\\'s definitive villains, And plenty of Picard\\'s adventures involved trying to stop the Borg from assimilating Earth.

Sadly, Picard wasn\\'t the only crew member they lost. Data, Counselor Troi, Guinan and Keiko all died tragically at the hands of the Borg.

BY DUSTIN HOLLANDStar Trek Locutus TNG\"Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise have been to the brightest stars and darkest corners of the Star Trek universe. One of their most iconic adventures is depicted across two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation entitled \"The Best of Both Worlds. \" The crew has a run-in with the Borg, A race of hive-mind-controlled aliens hellbent on assimilating the universe into their collective. In the special, Picard is captured by the Borg and forced to become Locutus, A sort of living command center. Fortunately for Picard and the people of Earth, The crew of the Enterprise is able to free Picard and stop the Borg before it wipes out the entire Federation and assimilates the entire human race. However, Things didn\\'t end so cleanly in one of Star Trek\\'s many divergent timelines. Writer Michael Jan Friedman and artist Peter Krause explore the answers to these daunting questions in their 1993 Star Trek: The Next Generation storyline \"The Worst of Both Worlds, \" which ran from Star Trek: TNG #47-50. The story begins on the Enterprise years after the events of \"The Best of Both Worlds. \" Picard and crew are on a fairly routine mission to Mardion Three, Which is uncomfortably close to Wolf 359, Where they once fought the Borg. Suddenly, They are pulled into an \"anomaly\" which pulls them into an alternate dimension. Before Picard and Riker can begin to understand what\\'s happened, They encounter a second Enterprise which quickly beams them aboard. Worf\\'s warrior instincts immediately kick in and he lunges at the mysterious people who have taken them onto their ship without permission only to find himself face to face with a version of himself. In fact, Everyone on this ship is a doppelganger of an Enterprise crew member. \"',\n",

As mentioned, Picard also ties into the most recent installment of \"Short Treks, \" which involves a terrorist attack by synthetic life forms that eventually leads to a ban on their creation — one of the many plot elements of \"Picard\" that has drawn criticism for being inconsistent with the original utopian vision of \"Star Trek. \"With so many new \"Trek\" shows on their way, This list will quickly become outdated.
